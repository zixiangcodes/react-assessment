                Domino's Pizza started with just one store called "DomiNick's" bought by brothers Tom and James Monaghan for $500 in 1960. James traded his half of the business to Tom in 1965, and as sole owner Tom renamed the business Domino's Pizza Inc. In 1978 the 200th Domino's store opened, and things really began to cook.
