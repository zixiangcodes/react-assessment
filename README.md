# React-Assessment
A simple React App with CRUD and Pagination features.

Created with Create React App. Pre-chatgpt era. 

# Introduction
As part of the assessment for React in the Fave Tech Hub program, I was required to make a React app project.
Besides applying what I've learned, I could use any resource online to complete this project. 

I chose Domino's Pizza, and to create a store order tracker with CRUD and pagination features. 

# Important Files:
I would say the most important JS files to look at are:
-	App.js
-	HomePage.js
-	OrderList.js (and its corresponding JS files)

# Reflection
There's a lot of things that I'd wish I'd done better before doing the code. Its a good learning experience.
Some of the things I have to plan better are:
- Understand what js files interacted with which.
- Website design
- Reading documentation of packages before using them.
- Asked people for help earlier if I was stuck or dealt with unfamiliar syntax.

Note: The pagination doesn’t reflect properly, and I wasn’t able to fix it. What I mean is, when a person adds a new customer, it doesn’t properly refresh the table (but the new entry was added). You would need to click a new page, then come back to the previous page to see it. I was told from a few experienced programmer it was due to having my dataset not connected to a database

# Instructions:
To run the it:
- cd crud 
- npm install 
- npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:5000 (or it will automatically open it) to view it in your browser.

# Credits:
- Thank you, to Fariz Gaskin for your classes!
- Special thanks to the Zero to Mastery Discord Server community for helping me understand what was wrong with my code.
- Huge thanks to Sean Christoph Gordon, one of my childhood friends (and now programmer buddy) for hearing my rants sometimes. 
- As always, grateful to Fave for the opportunity to work in the FaveTech Hub program. 

# Disclaimer: 
This app was made as part my learning and training, and is not optimized well.
Additionally, there might be some redundant dependencies that are not used that will be installed, so apologies for that.
